# The Philosophy of RVal

Why reactive values? In essence most of our programming work consists of transfering in-memory information from one place to another, transforming the information into new information, that is either human or machine digestable.
Data tranformations always introduces reduces redundant copies of data that need to be kept in sync with the original data.
In very trivial example of this problem might look like:

```javascript
const user = {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Stanford",
    fullName: "Jane Stanford"
}

document.body.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello ${user.fullName}</h1>
```

This simple snippet introduces a redundant copy of the original user's name in the `fullName` property, and in the DOM.
Now it has become the programmers responsibility to make sure any futher changes to the `user` are propagated properly:

```javascript
function updateFirstName(newName) {
    user.firstName = newName
    user.fullName = user.firstName + " " + user.lastName
    document.body.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello ${user.fullName}</h1>
}
```

This is the problem that any state management abstraction, regardless the framework or paradigm that is used, is trying to solve.
RVal introduces a handful of primitives that help you to solve this problem in any context, by automating the question:
_when_ should _which_ transformation be applied?

Here is a quick overview in how RVal helps solving that problem.
First, we should recognize that imperatively computing new information, such as the DOM represantation, introduces stale values.
However, we can avoid ever storing such information by storing _computations_, rather than _values_.
The process for that is as simple as creating a _thunk_ (argumentless function) that capture the computation, rather than imperatively producing new values:

```javascript
const user = {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Stanford",
    fullName: () => user.firstName + " " + user.lastName
}

const rendering = () => `<h1>Hello ${user.fullName()}</h1>`

document.body.innerHTML = rendering()

function updateFirstName(newName) {
    user.firstName = newName
    document.body.innerHTML = rendering()
}
```

We've made things slightly better now; we don't have to imperatively update `user.fullName` anymore if the name changes.
Similarly, we could captured the rendered representation of the user in the thunk called `rendering`.

By storing computations instead of values, we have reduced the amount of redundant information.
However, we still have to make sure that our changes are propagated, for example by updating the DOM whenever we change the `firstName` property.

But, what if we could _subscribe_ to our thunks? And thereby avoid the need to manually propagate state changes, and increasing decoupling in the process?
In other words, what if we could write something like:

```javascript
const user = { /* as-is */ }
const rendering = () => `<h1>Hello ${user.fullName()}</h1>`

on(rendering, () => {
    document.body.innerHTML = rendering()
})

function updateFirstName(newName) {
    user.firstName = newName
}
```

Well, here is the good news: This is exactly the kind of things RVal allows you to write, by introducing three concepts:

1. `val(value)` to create pieces of information that can change over time
2. `drv(thunk)` to create thunks that can be subscribed to
3. `sub(something, listener)` to create a listener that fires whenever the provided reactive value or thunk changes

With those concepts, we can rewrite our above listing as a combination of reactive values and thunks, that propagate the changes when needed!

```javascript
import { val, drv, sub } from "rval"

const user = {
    firstName: val("Jane"),
    lastName: val("Stanford"),
    fullName: drv(() => user.firstName() + " " + user.lastName())
}

const rendering = drv(`<h1>Hello ${user.fullName()}</h1>`)

// subscribe to the 'rendering' thunk
sub(rendering, () => {
    document.body.innerHTML = rendering()
})

function updateFirstName(newName) {
    // change the `firstName` reactive value to 'newName'
    // rval will make sure that any derivation and subscription impacted by this
    // change will be re-evaluated (and nothing more).
    user.firstName(newName)
}
```


## Functions solidify state

At this point you might be wondering:
"But _why_ is it interesting to trap our state inside these `val` functions?"

By trapping all our pieces of state inside `val` functions, 
we achieved a very interesting property:
We've practically forced ourselfs to have a single source of truth.
Instead of passing the _values of our state_ around, we can now pass a _references to our state_ around.
The benefit of this that it will stop us from accidentally creating redundant copies of our state.

Take for example the following contrived function. 
It creates a random number generator, which is more likely to generate our lucky number than any other number: 

```javascript
function createNumberGenerator(luckyNumber) {
    return function numberGenerator() {
        return Math.random() < 0.5 ? luckyNumber : Math.round(Math.random() * 100)
    }
}

let luckyNumber = 13
const generator = createNumberGenerator(luckyNumber)
console.log(generator()) // 13
console.log(generator()) // 50
console.log(generator()) // 49

luckyNumber = 42
console.log(generator()) // 28
console.log(generator()) // 13
console.log(generator()) // 13
```

Now at this point, updating our `luckyNumber` variable doesn't get reflected in the `numberGenerator` anymore.
We are forced now to create a new number generator to reflect the change in our preference. 
The problem is that the `luckyNumber` has been "trapped" as argument to `createNumberGenerator`. 
The argument is basically a _copy_ of the original `luckyNumber` variable. 

However, it is easy to see that by passing _functions_ around, we avoid this whole problem. 
Because `luckyNumber` itself now becomes a `const` reference to the function that traps our lucky number. 
(Yes, `let` and `var` really become anti-patterns when using `rval`).


```javascript
function createNumberGenerator(luckyNumber) {
    return function numberGenerator() {
        // luckyNumber get's evaluated lazily when generating numbers
        return Math.random() < 0.5 ? luckyNumber() : Math.round(Math.random() * 100)
    }
}

const luckyNumber = val(13) // luckyNumber is a const now!
const generator = createNumberGenerator(luckyNumber)
console.log(generator()) // 13
console.log(generator()) // 13
console.log(generator()) // 22

luckyNumber(42) // change our minds
console.log(generator()) // 42
console.log(generator()) // 8
console.log(generator()) // 42
```

By capturing values in functions, it becomes much more explicit when we want to pass a _reference_, and when a _value_.
If we want our number generator to take a one-time snapshot of the state as `luckyNumber` we can be explicit about it and _explicitly_ pass a copy of the current state `createNumberGenerator(luckyNumber())`.
On the other hand, we can also explicitly pass a reference to the state by just passing the `luckyNumber` function itself as we did above. 

As it turns out, in many cases it is very intersting to pass around a reference instead of a value. 
Especially when we are building systems that are supposed to be reactive, such as a user interface.
But that for later sections.

Note that the essence of `val` is simply this: 

```javascript
function val(initial) {
    let state = initial
    return function() {
        if (!arguments.length)
            return state
        state = arguments[0]
    }
}
```

RVal's implementation is a little more involved, but that is because it is possible to subscribe to the `state` of a `val`.
But the above is how you can conceptually think about them. 

But, let's [get started](http://localhost:3000/docs-getting-started) with the core "rval" api first!
