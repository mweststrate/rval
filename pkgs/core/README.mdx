# @r-val/core

`@r-val/core` package contains all the core functionality of RVal. 
The most important concepts are explain on the [getting started](#/introduction/the-basics) page.

## `val`

**Signature** 

`val(initialValue, preProcessor?) -> reactive value`

**Description**

`val` creates a reactive value that can be used to store state.
The `initialValue` froms the initial state of the reative value.

`val` returns a function that takes zero or one arguments:
* If the function is invoked without arguments, the current value is returned
* If the function is invoked with one argument, and that value is not a function, the argument becomes the new state of the reactive value. (If you want to store a function itself as value, use `val(() => fn)` instead of `val(fn)`)
* If the function is invoked with a function as argument, that function is invoked and should produce the new state, based on the current state. Built-in update functions can be found in the [`@r-val/updaters` package](#/api/updaters).

```javascript
const temperature = val(37)
console.log(temperature()) // prints 37

temperature(38)
console.log(temperature()) // prints 38

temperature(v => v + 1)
console.log(temperature()) // prints 39
```

For the `preProcessor` argument, see [#/advanced/preprocessors]. `preProcessor` can both be a single pre-processor, or an array of pre-processors.

## `drv`

**Signature**

`drv(derivation, setter?) -> reactive value`

**Description**

`drv` creates a derived, reactive value. It accepts a single function (which should not have side effects),
and it will automatically subscribe to all reactive values that were accessed when running that function.
The output of the function is cached until one observed reactive values changes.

Generally, it is recommended to use `drv` abunduntaly; every `drv` is a potential caching point, making change propagation trough your system easier.
It will also help you reduce the amount of _state_ you have in your application, and under almost all circumstances it is better
to have a piece of derived information, over some redundant information that is kept up to date through other means (such as `sub`).

The optional `setter` argument can be used to make the derived value writable. 
This is just syntactic convenience, as the `drv` itself does not hold state, but it can be used as 'write-through' mechanism.
Setters are automatically wrapped in an `act`.

```javascript
const priceDollar = val(10)
const euroDollarRate = val(1.1487)

const priceEuro = drv(
    // derive the price in euro
    () => priceDollar() / euroDollarRate(),
    // setter: makes priceEuro writeable
    (newPriceEur) => {
        priceDollar(newPriceEur * euroDollarRate()) 
    }
)

console.log(priceEuro()) // 8.71
priceEuro(10)
console.log(priceDollar()) // 11.49
```

By default, RVal assumes that a `drv` that is not observed itself by anyone (by a `drv`, `sub` or `effect) is not relevant anymore,
and it will automatically suspend the computation, meaning that it will stop observing it's inputs on the next JavaScript tick.
This is done to make sure no memory leaks are introduced. If you want to forcefully cache the `drv` output under all circumstances, use `keepAlive` from `@r-val/utils`.

## `sub`

**Signature**

* `sub(source, listener, options) -> disposer` &mdash; the default way to create a subscription to an reactive `source`
* `sub(listener, options) -> (source) -> disposer` &mdash; create a curried subscription, 

**Subscription `options`:**

* `fireImmediately` (default `false`). `true`: the listener should be immediately invoked, or `false`: only when the first _change_ is observed in `source`.

**Listener arguments:**

* `value`
* `previousValue`

**Description**

`sub` subscribe to a reative value. 
It will trigger for each change in the reactive value, but only once per batch (see `act`).
`sub` is the primary means to create side effects that are triggered by reactive values,
such as logging, updating a rendering, or makign network requests.
(In the end, any system needs side effects, to be able to perform output).

`sub` returns a disposer function, that stops future executions of the `listener` once called.

```javascript
import { val, sub, drv } from "@r-val/core"

function createTodo(id, initialTitle) {
    const title = val(initialTitle)
    const done = val(false)
    const toJS = drv(() => ({
        id,
        title: title(),
        done: done()
    }))

    // set up a subscription to automatically save the 
    // todo when either title or done changes
    const stop = sub(toJS, data => {
        window.fetch("http://host/todos/" + id, { 
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify(data)
        }).catch(e => {
            console.error(e)
        }) 
    })

    return {
        title, done, toJS, stop
    }
}

const myTodo = createTodo(1, "get cofee")
myTodo.title("get coffee") // will be saved automatically
myTodo.stop() // stop future executions of the subscription
```

In cases, it might be tempting to update other reactive values in a subscription,
but in most cases this is an anti pattern and the value-to-be-updated could be expressed as derived value using `drv` instead.

The curried version of the `sub` can be useful to create utilities, for example a `logger` that prints the values of any state transition:

```javascript
const log = sub((current, previous) => {
    console.log(`${previous} -> ${current}`)
})

log(someReactiveValue)
log(someOtherReactiveValue)
```

N.B. this utility is actually built-in as `logChanges` in the `@r-val/utils` package.

## `act`

**signature**

`act(function) -> function` 

**discription**

`act` takes accepts a function, and returns a function with the same signature, that, when invoked, will batch the updates.
This is also called an _action_. 
This means, that if multiple mutations in that same function would normally affect multiple invocations of the same side-effect,
an function wrapped in `act` will trigger the side effects at most once. 

Although it is very well possible to create and invoke an action in one go (like: `act(() => { /* someStuff */ })()`),
it is recommended to not do this. Updates that are grouped together are a nice opportunity to extract a single function with limited functionality.

If functions that are wrapped by `act` invoke other functions wrapped by `act`, side effects will only trigger once the outer `act` completes.

That's all! Note that `act` only batches _synchronosly_ run updates. Passing an `async` function to `act` is in that regard mostly useless (only the code until the first `await` will be batched in that case).
Calling individual actions from `async` functions is no problem. 

## `effect`

**signature**

`effect(functionToTrack: () -> T, onInvalidate: (didChange() -> boolean, pull() -> T)): disposerFunction` 

**description**

`effect` is a core building block to organize side effects. 
For example `sub` and `@r-val/react`'s `rview` use `effect` under the hood.
`effect` tracks a function (that might produce a value), and notifies the `onInvalidate` callback when 
some of the dependencies of the tracked function _might_ have changed.

`effect` basically produces a state machine with the following states / contract (it initializes at step 7!):

1. The `functionToTrack` is executed, and the effect records which reactive values where used during the executions
2. If one or more of those dependencies might have changed, `onInvalidate` is called, with two parameters; `didChange()` and `pull()`
3. At any point in time, `didChange()` should be called. This will make sure that the dependencies are actually _evaluated_ (the effect might be depending on derived values that have not been evauated so far).
4. If `didChange()` returns `false`, nothing did actually changed, and `onInvalidate` might be invoked again if dependencies change in the future. (Go back to 2.)
5. If `didChange()` returns `true`, `pull()` should be called at any point in time in the future. `pull()` will perform step 1 again (tracking the function), register the dependencies, and returns any value it yields.
6. If the `disposer` returned from `effect` is called at any moment in time, the effect is immediately disposed, cleaning up the dependency tree.
7. Initially, the state machine is kicked of by calling `onInvalidate` once, starting basically at step 3. (Note that `didChange` will always yield `true` the first time)


Note that `onInvalidate` won't be called again, until `didChange()` is called and returned `false`, 
or `pull()` is called.

You probably won't use `effect` much in practice (using `sub` is more straightforward), 
but `effect` is a good building block to create utility functions that have very specific caching or timing behavior.

For example, an alternative to `sub(source, listener)` that debounces the listener and at max triggers its listener
every x milliseconds could be defined as:

```javascript
function sub(src, listener, delay) {
    let lastSeen = undefined

    return effect(
        () => src(),
        (didChange, pull) => {
            if (didChange()) {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    const v = pull()
                    if (v !== lastSeen)
                        listener(v, lastSeen)
                    lastSeen = v
                }, delay);
            }
        }
    )
}
```

## `configure`

**Signature**

`configure(options)`

**Configuration options**

* `deepFreeze`: automatically deeply freezes any values arrays or plain objects that are stored in a reactive value. Best enabled in development enviroments. Default: `true`. Should be disabled in production enviroments for optimal performance.

Set's the the options for the current RVal instance (see also `rval` and `defaultInstance`).


## `rval`

Signature: 

* `rval()` &mdash; creates a _new_ RVal instance
* `rval(reactiveValue)` &mdash; returns the RVal instances that created the given reactive value.

Returns an rval instance, that exposes the APIs:

* `val`
* `drv`
* `sub`
* `act`
* `effect`
* `configure`

## `defaultInstance`

The default RVal instance used by all the top-level api's exposed by the module. 
For more info about what an RVal instance is, see `rval`.
