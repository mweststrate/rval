## useVal

**Signature**

`useVal(reactiveValue) -> currentValue`

**Description**

_This function is a React hook, currently, it can only be used with React 16.7.0-alpha. use `rview` in all other cases_

Given a reactive value, subscribes the current React function component to the value. 
It returns the current state, and make sure the component is re-rendered on the next change of the value.

Example ([try online](https://codesandbox.io/s/m297j6w38)):

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { val } from "@r-val/core"
import { useVal } from "@r-val/react"

const counter = val(0)

const Counter = () => {
    const c = useVal(counter)
    return (<>
        {c}
        <button onClick={() => counter(0)}>
            Reset
        </button>
    </>)
}

setInterval(() => {
    counter(c => c + 1)
}, 1000);

render(<Counter />, document.body)
```

## rview

**Signature**

`rview(render: () => ReactNode, memo?, rvalInstance?) -> ReactElement`

**Description**

`rview` can be used inside the render part of any React component, to render the given `render`  function
and track which reactive values it is using.
`rview` will make sure that every time that reactive values involved in the rendering change, the function is called again.

Example ([try online](https://codesandbox.io/s/m297j6w38)):

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { val } from "@r-val/core"
import { useVal } from "@r-val/react"

const counter = val(0)

const Counter = () => rview(() => (
    <>
        {counter()}
        <button onClick={() => counter(0)}>
            Reset
        </button>
    </>
))

setInterval(() => {
    counter(c => c + 1)
}, 1000);

render(<Counter />, document.body)
```

The `memo` argument can be used to further optimize the rendering, and takes three possible values:
* `false` (the default). If `memo` is `false`, the `rview` will _also_ re-render if the owning component re-renders. The reason for that is that a new render function is passed in to the `rview`, which might be referring variables in it's closure. (For example state or calbacks defined in the owining component).
* `true`. Use `true` if the render function is pure and doesn't rely on anything from it's closure, but only on reactive values (which are tracked). 
* `[inputs]`. Use an array of inputs (similarly to for example the `inputs` arguments of React's `useEffect` hook. This will cache the rendering of the `rview`, until either some reactive value used changes, or some of the inputs are not pointer equal.

For more details: see the [unit tests](https://github.com/mweststrate/rval/blob/2a861ebfbfcc359b130269d286b00183abae2ef1/pkgs/react/tests/rview.spec.tsx#L141-L319)

The `rvalInstance` argument can be used to use a different `RValInstance` for tracking. See also the [`@r-val/core`](#/api/core) documentation.

## useLocalVal
- context

**Signature**

`useLocalVal(initialValue, rvalInstance?) -> reactiveValue`

**Description**

_This function is a React hook, currently, it can only be used with React 16.7.0-alpha. use `rview` in all other cases_

`useLocalVal` creates a `val` that is used to store state in a reactive value that is owned by the current function component.
The component will always re-render if a new value is pushed into the reactive value. 


## useLocalDrv

**Signature**

`useLocalDrv(derivation: () -> value, inputs?, rvalInstance?) -> currentValue`

**Description**

_This function is a React hook, currently, it can only be used with React 16.7.0-alpha. use `rview` in all other cases_

Creates a `drv` which is local to the current component, subscribes to it, and returns it current value.
Normally, the `drv` instance will be the same for the entire life-cycle of the component. 
So, if the output of the `drv` depends on non-rval state or props, normally the derivation wouldn't re-evaluate.
The `inputs` argument can be used to make sure changes in the inputs are reflected as well. 
Example:

```javascript
function CounterMultiplier(({ multiplier })) => {
    const counter = useLocalVal(0)
    // The derivation will automatically react to counter(), as it is a reactive value,
    // however, multiplier is a plain input, so we have to pass it as 'input' to make sure
    // the derivation updates as well if that one changes
    const total = useLocalDrv(() => {
        return counter() * multiplier
    }, [multiplier])

    return <div>{total}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(<CounterMultiplier multiplier=2 />, document.body)
