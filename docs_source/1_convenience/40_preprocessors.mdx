# Pre-processors

By default, any new value state stored in a `val` is automatically deeply frozen, even the value is a plain array or object.

The `preProcessor` argument to apply some preprocessing on the values that are being stored, or perform validations.
The signature of a pre-processor is: `(newValue, currentValue, rvalInstance) -> newValue`. Where:
 * `newValue` the value that is about to be stored
 * `currentValue` the value that is currently stored
 * `rvalInstance` the current RVal instance (see the `rval()` function)
 * The return value is the value that will be passed to the next pre-processor, or if there is none, that will be stored.

It is possible to chain multiple pre processors, by simply passing an array of preprocessors to `val`.

`val` uses pointer equality to detect and propagate updates. So if your previous detects that the current update can or needs to be aborted, just `return currentValue`.

For example, the following reactive value `profit` has two pre-processors. 
The first one automatically converts new values to strings,
the second one performs some validation, refusing to store numbers that 
are smaller then the previous value.

```javascript
function convertToNumber(newValue) {
    if (typeof newValue === "number")
        return newValue
    else
        return parseFloat(newValue)
}

const profit = val(0, [
    // convert input to number
    convertToNumber,
    // check if profits increase
    (newValue, currentValue) => {
        if (newValue < currentValue)
            throw new Error("Invariant failed! Profits should increase")
        return newValue
    }
])

profit(-5) // Throws exception: Profits should increase

profit("7") // Parses the number, and sets profit to number 7
```
