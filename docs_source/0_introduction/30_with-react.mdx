# Using RVal with React

RVal is in essence framework agnostic. 
But, official bindings for React are available through the `@r-val/react` package.
(This package is a very thin layer around the `effect` function).

## `useVal`: Subscribe with hooks

The simplest way to consume a reactive value in a component is to use the `useVal` hook.
Note that `useVal` uses React hooks, which aren't officially released yet! 
We just start with those because they are conceptually the most straight-forward, but RVal will work with any version of React 16.

The `useVal` hook can be passed any reactive value (either an `val` or `drv`), and makes sure the component subscribes to the changes in this value.
It simply returns the current state of the reactive value passed.
Note that `useVal` doesn't return a setter function! To update the reactive value, just call the reactive value directly with a new value, as shown below in the `onClick` handler:

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { val } from "@r-val/core"
import { useVal } from "@r-val/react"

const counter = val(0)

const Counter = () => {
    const c = useVal(counter)
    return (<>
        {c}
        <button onClick={() => counter(0)}>
            Reset
        </button>
    </>)
}

setInterval(() => {
    counter(c => c + 1)
}, 1000);

render(<Counter />, document.body)
```

## `rview`: Reactive views

With `useVal`, we can pick one by one all the reactive values we wan't to subscribe to. 
This is quite explicit, but it easy to subscribe to to few, or too many reactive values.
And more important, `useVal` is quite limited; due to the nature of hooks it is not possible to 
conditionally subscribe to reactive values. 
While in practice not all values might always be relevant in all states of the component!

So, that is where `rview` comes in! 
`rview` is conceptually very similar to `drv`, except that it is specialized to produce and update React components. 
`rview` takes a render callback (without arguments) and returns an `RView` component instance. 
The neat thing is that `rview` will automatically keep track of all the reactive values that are used in the render callback, and subscribes to them,
so that you don't have to. 
(And it will even unsubscribe from reactive values that are (temporarily) unused). 
So with `rview`, our previous counter simply boils down to the following, and note that `counter()` can be called directly in the render callback:


```javascript
import React from "react"
import { render } from "react-dom"
import { val } from "@r-val/core"
import { useVal } from "@r-val/react"

const counter = val(0)

const Counter = () => rview(() => (
    <>
        {counter()}
        <button onClick={() => counter(0)}>
            Reset
        </button>
    </>
))

setInterval(() => {
    counter(c => c + 1)
}, 1000);

render(<Counter />, document.body)
```

_Tip: `rview` doesn't require hooks, so it works in any React 16.+ version._

Note that `rview` is quite optimized out of the box. When using RVal with `rview`, you shouldn't need `shouldComponentUpdate` hooks, and it is recommended to write `PureComponent` / `memo` based components.
