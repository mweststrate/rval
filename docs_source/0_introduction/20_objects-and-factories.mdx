# Working with objects and arrays

So far we only used stand-alone reactive values to capture our state.
But in real world applications we will need complex objects or state trees.
But suprisingly, RVal however doesn't offer a primitive to work with objects or array.
Instead:

_consider every object or array as an immutable collection of reactive values_

By keeping objects and arrays themself immutable, it turns out that the mental model remains much simpler,
and the API surface that is needed to apply reactivity is much[^1] smaller.

But, that doesn't RVal is awkward of inconvenient when working with objects.
Instead, it turns out that using objects, which are structurally immutable, but contain stateful reactive values, are presently convenient to work with.

Let's start a bit simple with an object that captures the state of a `Todo` item (with apologies for the uninspired example):

```javascript
const title = val('Get coffee')
const done = val(false)

const myFirstTodo = {
  title,
  done,
}

title.done(true)
console.log(title.done())
```

Pretty straight forward eh? Note that we used only `const` values, and that `myFirstTodo` itself should be treated as an immutable objects to keep the conceptuel model simple.
(In fact, it would be recommended to use `Object.freeze(myFirstTodo)`, but it turns out that RVal will take care of that as well in most cases, as we will discover later).

## A first object factory

Probably you don't want to create multiple todo's in your application, intead of one.
To ease that process we can make a _factory_ funtion:

```javascript
function createTodo(initialTitle) {
  const title = val(initialTitle)
  const done = val(false)
  return {
    title,
    done,
  }
}

const myFirstTodo = createTodo("Get coffee")
myFirstTodo.done(true)
```

Ok, that was easy! But our factory function can do more than just instating some reactive values and combining them into an object.
We can add define derived data using `drv`, and actions using `act`, and make them part of the object as well:

```javascript
function createTodo(initialTitle) {
    const title = val(initialTitle)
    const done = val(false)
    const asMarkdown(() => done() ? " * [x] ~" + title() + "~" : " * [ ] " +title())
    const toggle = act(() {
        done(!done())
    })

    return {
        title, done, toggle, asMarkdown
    }
}
```

So, we now have a factory that creates an immutable object, containing some reactive values, derivations and actions. 
Note that we are only creating `const`s in these listing, and we neatly avoided using `this`, which might save some headaches down the road![^2]

Let's put our code to the test and create a `sub` to observe the effects of our state updates:

```javascript
const myFirstTodo = createTodo("Get coffee")
sub(myFirstTodo.asMarkdown, md => {
    console.log(md)
}

myFirstTodo.title("Get coffee and cookie")
// Prints: * [ ] Get coffee and cookie

myFirstTodo.toggle()
// Prints: * [x] ~Get coffee and cookie~
```

Yeah, our first factory is a fact!

_Tip: When starting with RVal, it will take mere seconds before you will forget parenthesis for the first and write `if (todo.done) ... ` instead of `if (todo.done())`. So be smart. Or, use TypeScript so that you don't have be (Granted, TypeScript won't catch all of those mistakes, but hopefully enough to learn the right habits)._ 


## Creating collections

At this point you might be wondering, ok, you tricked me with objects. But how do I organize a collection of todo items, with just using `val`. 
The answer is: we'll repeat the same trick.
Let's quickly design a factory for a "todoStore":

```javascript
function createTodoStore() {
    const todos = val([])

    function addTodo(title) {
        todos([
            ...todos(),
            createTodo(title)
        ])
    }

    return { todos, addTodo }
}

const store = createTodoStore()
store.addTodo("Go for a walk")
console.log(tore.todos().map(todo => todo.title())) // prints: ["Go for a walk"]
```

See what we did there? We introduced a `val` to maintain our collection of todos, but the value we assign to it/ read from it, we still consider it as immutable!
So, we always replace the entire collection. But, we recycle all the contents, so it isn't to involved. 
So, when using RVal, the recommended approach is to always produces those trees that are immutable themselves, but have stateful reactive values inside them, which always store a scalar value, but their contents aren't actively mutated.
In fact, by default RVal will help you with that; it will automatically deeply freeze any value you store in `val`!
This makes sure that an error will throw if you accidentally write something that would otherwise mutate the contents, like `store.todos().push(createTodo("Go for a walk))`.
This way of organizing could be expressed as: using _immutable, but stateful objects_.

_Note: that this approach doesn't suffer too much from writing complex deep updates, because a deep update is just reads until you arrive at the location for the update. You don't have to produce an entire new state tree. For example this is a valid "deep update": `store.todos()[0].done(true)`_

_Tip: The autofreeze behavior can be disabled for performance reasons, by using `configure({ autoFreeze: false })`._

## Using classes

You might be wondering whether it is possible to use classes instead of factory functions. 
The answer is, yes that is perfectly possible. 
The reason for the chose approach in this documentation however, is that it hopefully set's you up for the [Pit of Success](https://medium.com/@ricomariani/the-pit-of-success-cfefc6cb64c8). 
Once you get used to this approach, there should be less places where you can accidentally error, you can't forget to bind a function,
and the mental model becomes really trivial: Nothing should or can't be modified. Except `val`s.

That being said, in an existing codebase it might be easier to start with introducing reactive values at certain places and keep the rest as is. 
If you are using TypeScript, it is highly recommended to use the `readonly` keyword when `val` as classfield: `readonly done = val(false)`.
This will protect you against accidental reassignments of the field.

For further inspiration, checkout the [prototype based example](https://github.com/mweststrate/rval/blob/c12d30ce7d43326fd062e59366902e14794eeed3/pkgs/core/tests/object.spec.ts#L100-L135) or [class based example](https://github.com/mweststrate/rval/blob/c12d30ce7d43326fd062e59366902e14794eeed3/pkgs/core/tests/object.spec.ts#L187-L220).

## Next steps

TODO: fix links

This page covered the basics of working with objects and collections in RVal. 
To dive a bit deeper, you might want to check these sections out later:
- Using updaters to simplify writing the update functions
- Using models to simplify and reduce the boilerplate of writing factories

[^1]: In MobX, roughly 75% of the code base is dealing with decorators, making plain data structures observable and dealing with the various different ways that people have to work with objects.
[^2]: For _super_ performance critical applications (measure before optimizing!), one could use `Object.create` and store all methods on the `prototype`. Those methods would then rely on using `this`, but it would avoid creating a closure for each method on each instance. See also the two examples linked in the "Using classes" section.
